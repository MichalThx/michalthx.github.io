				<h2>What's is the Fantasty.Doctor?</h2>
				<p>'Fantasy.Doctor' is a website I have made as a way to improve the experience of the professional league of legends matches.</p>

				<p>In summary, 'league of legends' is one of the most popular e-sports game in the world and gathers millions of fans tuning in for the games. However, the ways fans can be involved and engage in the games are quite limited as the only options are watching and commenting.</p>

				<b class="under_image">Individual statistics for each player of a team</b>
				<p>In regular sports (i.e. Premier League in the UK), fans can be involved with fantasy league. This is a game where users create a virtual team and fill it with players playing in the real league. The scoring of each team works as a sum of the players' stats like goals / assits  multiplied by the value of each stat. </p>
				<img class = 'no_radius_image'  src="content_lol/images/fd2.PNG">
				<b class="under_image">Results for pick them.</b>
				<p>Other popular option for engagement is 'pick them'. It works like a guessing game for each match where users pick who supposed to win the game. If they are correct they gain points otherwise nothings happens. Players with most points wins. Quite simple way to achieve much more involvement from users to watch more games and more fun from users' perspective as they can actively compete against everyone from around the world or just their friends.</p>

				<b class="under_image">Choosing players.</b>
				<p>Those two simple ways to improve the experience were not properly addressed by any of the existing solutions. This prompted me to create 'Fantasy.Doctor', place where everyone can create teams from China, Korea, America or Europe(1) and select some picks for those leagues as well. </p>

				<h2>How does it work?</h2>
				<p>From a technical standpoint, the website has a two way interacting with the world. Firstly, it gathers the information. This is done via series of Python scripts which deal with getting the data, modifying and uploading it into the database. Due to the constraints of real world where servers error happen, the highest priority was the error mitigation and allowing for a safe failover in case something goes wrong. At this point the website has the most current information available (2) and it is ready for the users. At this stage, the users will create their picks, search for their perfect player, manage salaries, create leagues with friends and more. In order to create the best possible product I could offer the users I have chosen Laravel with Vue.js. </p>
				<p>This combination enabled quick development of a bit convoluted website with easy to manage decoupled design. It should be noted the first design from first draft to live website took about one month with time spent handling various APIs including those in Mandarin. As a bonus, GDPR was a much nicer read than anticipated and the hardest part about setting the server was the DNS.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>(1) Those are the four major leagues in the professional 'league of legends': LPL, LCK, LEC, LCS.</p>
				<p>(2) Sometime, the information gathered by the website is not yet available outside of China.</p>
